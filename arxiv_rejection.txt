Dear author,

Thank you for submitting your work to arXiv. We regret to inform you that arXivâ€™s moderators have determined that your submission will not be accepted and made public on [1]arXiv.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our moderators determined that your submission does not contain sufficient original or substantive scholarly research and is not of interest to arXiv.

For more information, please see [2]https://arxiv.org/help/moderation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

arXiv moderators strive to balance fair assessment with decision speed. We understand that this decision may be disappointing, and we apologize that, due to the high volume of submissions arXiv receives, we cannot offer more detailed feedback. Some authors have found that asking their personal network of colleagues or submitting to a conventional journal for peer review are alternative avenues to obtain feedback.&nbsp;

We appreciate your interest in arXiv and wish you the best.&nbsp;

Sincerely,&nbsp;

The arXiv Content Management &amp; User Support Team
